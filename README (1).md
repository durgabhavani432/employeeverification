# 🧾 Employee Background Check Application (Frontend Version)

## 📌 Project Title
**Employee Background Check Application (Frontend Version)**

---

## 💡 Project Concept
The **Employee Background Check Application** is a simple web-based system that allows user registration, login, and management of employee records.  
It is designed to simulate an employee verification platform where registered users can add, view, and update the background verification status of employees.

This version is **frontend-only**, built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, with **localStorage** used to simulate data persistence (no backend or database yet).

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🔐 User System
- **Registration**: Users can create an account with a name, email, and password.  
- **Login/Logout**: Existing users can log in using their credentials and securely log out.  
- **LocalStorage persistence**: Registered users and employees are stored locally on the browser.

### 👨‍💼 Employee Management
- **Add Employee**: Input employee details such as name, email, phone, company, position, and education.  
- **Dynamic Employee Table**: Displays all employees with an auto-generated ID and avatar.  
- **Status Update**: Admin can mark employees as **Verified**, **Failed**, or keep them **Pending**.  
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove employee records instantly.  
- **Real-time Updates**: All actions dynamically refresh the employee list without reloading the page.

### 🧠 Smart UI Features
- User-friendly design using CSS and responsive layout.  
- Each employee row displays a colored badge based on their verification status:  
  🟢 Verified | 🔴 Failed | 🟠 Pending  
- Uses icons and form input groups for a professional look.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (for Backend Integration)

1. **Backend API Integration**
   - Connect to a database (MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase).

   - Secure password storage using hashing.

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Add admin/user roles for different permission levels.

3. **Advanced Background Verification**
   - Integrate external APIs to check real employment or education history.

4. **Search and Filter System**
   - Allow filtering employees by status, company, or position.

5. **Dark Mode and UI Enhancements**
   - Provide a toggle for light/dark themes.

6. **Email Notifications**
   - Notify employees via email upon verification or failure.
